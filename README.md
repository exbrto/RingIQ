## About

People who train alone, at home or in the gym without a coach, don't have anyone watching their technique. Bad habits like dropping the guard, not fully extending a jab, or cutting squats short go unnoticed and turn into habits.

RingIQ is a full-stack web app that acts as a coach in your corner. You upload a video of your boxing, Muay Thai, kickboxing, or strength session, and RingIQ tracks your body through the video, counts your strikes and reps, grades your form, and saves your results so you can see how your technique improves over time.

## How It Works

1. **Pick a discipline** (boxing, Muay Thai/kickboxing, or strength) and upload a video of your session.
2. **Watch it get analyzed.** The video plays with a skeleton drawn over your body while strikes and reps are counted in real time.
3. **Get your results.** See your overall score, a breakdown by technique, your most common mistake, and what to work on next.
4. **Track your progress.** Sessions are saved to your history so you can follow your scores, streaks, and improvement over time.

## Privacy

Your video never leaves your device. All of the video analysis happens in the browser, and only your session stats (counts, scores, and feedback) are saved to the database.
